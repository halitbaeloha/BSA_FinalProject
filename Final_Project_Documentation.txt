1. Overview and Purpose
The script is designed to process EEG data for sleep state analysis. It loads raw EEG data from a binary file, preprocesses the data in manageable chunks, extracts key spectral features through power spectral density (PSD) analysis, tags epochs into different sleep states, and finally visualizes and quantifies the results. The primary steps are:
•	Data Loading and Preprocessing: Reading the EEG file in chunks, applying a low-pass Butterworth filter, downsampling, and smoothing.
•	Feature Extraction: Calculating the root mean square (RMS) for each epoch and computing PSD to extract spectral features.
•	Sleep State Tagging: Classifying epochs into different sleep states (Wake, NREM, REM, Transition) based on spectral power ratios.
•	Visualization: Generating multiple plots (e.g., spectrogram, hypnogram, scatter plots, histograms) to visualize the EEG features and sleep states.
•	Sleep State Analysis: Creating histograms and duration analysis of the time spent in each sleep state.
2. Data Preprocessing
File Loading and Chunk-Based Processing
Chunk-Based Reading:
The code opens an EEG binary file and reads it in fixed-size chunks. This approach is memory efficient and ensures that large datasets can be processed without overwhelming system memory.
Conversion and Filtering:
Each chunk is first converted from 16-bit integers to double precision for accurate numerical processing.
Then, a 4th-order Butterworth low-pass filter is applied using zero-phase filtering (via filtfilt). Why Butterworth? The Butterworth filter is chosen because of its maximally flat frequency response in the passband, meaning it does not introduce ripples or distortions. Its smooth roll-off ensures that high-frequency noise (above the cutoff of 100 Hz) is effectively suppressed without affecting the lower frequency bands that are critical for sleep analysis.
Downsampling: After filtering, the data is downsampled from 32,000 Hz to 1,000 Hz, significantly reducing the dataset size while preserving the relevant information for sleep state analysis.
Smoothing: The entire downsampled EEG signal is smoothed using a Gaussian window to further reduce noise and transient artifacts, which helps in obtaining more stable spectral estimates.
3. RMS Calculation
Purpose: The RMS (root mean square) of the raw EEG is computed for each 15-minute epoch. Why RMS? The RMS provides a measure of the signal’s amplitude or energy,  which can be correlated with various sleep states. It is calculated over non-overlapping epochs, offering a per-epoch quantification that is useful for subsequent comparisons with spectral features.
4. PSD Computation and Spectral Analysis
Why Use PSD over a Simple FFT?
Power Spectral Density (PSD):
PSD represents the power distribution of the EEG signal across different frequency bands.
It is computed using Welch’s method, which involves segmenting the signal, windowing each segment (with a Hamming window in this case), computing the FFT for each segment, and averaging the results.
Advantages of PSD (Welch’s Method):
Smoothing and Averaging: Welch’s method averages multiple FFTs to provide a smoother and more reliable estimate of the spectral power.
Noise Reduction: Averaging reduces the variance of the spectral estimate, making it more robust against noise.
Quantitative Analysis: The PSD facilitates the calculation of band-specific power (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta) by integrating the power over defined frequency ranges.

Normalization and Spectral Ratios
•	Normalization:
The PSD is normalized by computing the total power within a sleep-relevant frequency band ([0.5–30 Hz]).
This ensures that the computed power in each band is relative to the total power in the bands of interest, making spectral ratios meaningful and comparable across epochs.
•	Spectral Ratios:
Ratios such as delta/beta, theta/alpha, and delta/theta are calculated to serve as features that correlate with different sleep states.
Thresholds are then applied to these ratios to tag each epoch into sleep states like Wakefulness, NREM, REM, or Transition.
5. Sleep State Tagging
Classification Logic: The code assigns sleep states based on defined thresholds for the computed spectral ratios. For example, an epoch is classified as NREM if both the delta/beta ratio and delta/theta ratio exceed set thresholds. Additional logic (using previous epoch information) is used to refine the classification, particularly for REM sleep versus Transition states.
6. Visualization
Multiple Plot Types
Spectrogram: Two spectrograms are generated: one using a log scale (dB) for visualizing power differences more clearly, and another with absolute power for sensitivity analysis.
Hypnogram: The hypnogram displays sleep state transitions over time, aligning the sleep states with the temporal progression of the EEG recording.
Scatter and Trend Plots: Scatter plots and line graphs show the relationships between EEG RMS and spectral ratios, aiding in the identification of outliers and trends.
Histograms and Duration Analysis: A color-coded histogram of epoch counts per sleep state and a bar chart of total duration (in minutes) per state provide a summary of the sleep architecture.
7. Conclusion
This script is a robust tool for sleep state analysis using EEG data. The preprocessing pipeline (chunk-based reading, Butterworth filtering, downsampling, and smoothing) ensures that the raw EEG is clean and manageable. The use of PSD, computed via Welch’s method, provides a reliable and smooth estimate of the signal’s power distribution, which is crucial for accurately computing spectral ratios. These ratios, along with RMS analysis, facilitate the classification of sleep states. Finally, detailed visualizations and duration analyses offer insights into the sleep architecture, making this script a comprehensive solution for sleep studies.
